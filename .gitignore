## Step 3: Create GitHub Actions Workflow File

1. In your project root, create the following directory structure:
   ```
   .github/workflows/
   ```

2. Create a new file in that directory named `flutter_build.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
name: Flutter Build

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Java
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          distribution: 'zulu'
          java-version: '11'

      - name: Setup Flutter
        uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
        with:
          flutter-version: '3.10.0'
          channel: 'stable'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: flutter pub get

      - name: Run build_runner for Hive adapters
        run: flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

      - name: Build APK
        run: flutter build apk --release

      - name: Upload APK
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: starfox-calendar-release
          path: build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
